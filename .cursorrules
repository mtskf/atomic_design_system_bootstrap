# Cursor Rules for CareSuper Design System

Always follow these rules when generating or editing code:

- Framework: Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript
- Styling: Tailwind CSS. No CSS-in-JS. Use semantic HTML and accessible roles/aria.
- Structure: src/components/{atoms,molecules,organisms,templates}/
- Stories: Create Storybook stories for every component under `*.stories.tsx` with Controls + a11y addon.
- Accessibility: All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible; include aria-* attributes and visible focus.
- Testing: Add basic React Testing Library tests for complex components.
- Docs: Before coding, read ./docs/atomic-design-system-spec.md and ./docs/component-checklist.md . If unclear, ask for clarifying questions.

When creating components:

- Export default React components.
- Provide example usage snippets in JSDoc.
- Keep props minimal; prefer composition and slots-like children.

File naming:

- PascalCase for components (e.g., Card.tsx), kebab-case for routes.

Language and Documentation:

- All new files, components, and documentation must be created in English.
- Comments, JSDoc, README files, and technical documentation should be in English.
- Only user-facing text (UI labels, error messages) may be localized via i18n.

Output expectations:

- Include stories, types, and basic tests in the same PR chunk.
